**Implement continuous delivery and integration in the AWS environment**

## What is this book about?
AWS provides a huge range of managed services. While each is well documented, figuring out how to use them together to build a business infrastructure is less clear. In this book, you’ll see how the most successful tech start-ups launch and scale their services on AWS and how you can too.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement automatic AWS instance provisioning using CloudFormation
* Deploy your application on a provisioned infrastructure with Ansible
* Manage infrastructure using Terraform
* Build and deploy a CI/CD pipeline with Automated Testing on AWS
* Understand the container journey for a CI/CD pipeline using AWS ECS
* Monitor and secure your AWS environment
